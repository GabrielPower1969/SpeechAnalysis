Speaker A: Um, I was thinking about trying that new restaurant downtown. You know, the one that just opened last week?

Speaker B: Oh yeah, I've heard about it! Like, everyone's been talking about it. Have you seen their menu?

Speaker A: Well, you know, I actually haven't had a chance to look at it yet. I was kind of hoping you might know something about it?

Speaker B: Um, I think they specialize in fusion cuisine. Like, they combine Asian and Mediterranean flavors.

Speaker A: That sounds interesting! You know what? We should probably make a reservation if we want to go this weekend.

Speaker B: Yeah, um, that's a good point. Should we check their website first?

Speaker A: Like, I already tried, but their online booking system isn't working yet.

Speaker B: You know what? We could just call them directly. I think they open at 11 AM.

Speaker A: Um, that's perfect! Should we aim for lunch or dinner?

Speaker B: Well, you know, dinner might be better. The atmosphere is supposed to be really nice in the evening.

Speaker A: Like, that makes sense. Should we invite Sarah and John too?

Speaker B: Um, that's a great idea! The more the merrier, right?

Speaker A: You know what? I'll text them right now to check their availability.

Speaker B: Perfect! Like, let me know what they say and then we can make the reservation.
