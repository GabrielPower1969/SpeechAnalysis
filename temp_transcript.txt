Speaker A: bad!Hey, how's it going?
Speaker B: bad!Oh, um, you know, pretty good. Just, like, trying to get through the week.
Speaker A: bad!Yeah, I hear that. It's been a bit hectic here too.
Speaker B: bad!Totally. So, um, did you see that new movie that came out?
Speaker A: bad!Oh, right! The sci-fi one? I was thinking about it, but I haven't had a chance yet.
Speaker B: bad!Yeah, that one. It was, like, really interesting. The special effects were amazing.
Speaker A: bad!! Was the story good? Sometimes they focus too much on the effects.
Speaker B: bad!Well, um, the story was okay, I guess. A bit predictable, you know?
Speaker A: goodAh, gotcha. That happens.
Speaker B: goodYeah. So, like, what are your plans for the weekend?
Speaker A: goodHmm, I don't know yet. Maybe just relax, um, catch up on some reading.
Speaker B: goodSounds good. I'm planning to, like, go hiking if the weather holds up.
Speaker A: goodOh, cool! Where are you thinking of going?
Speaker B: goodUh, probably just a local trail, you know? Nothing too strenuous.
Speaker A: goodHave fun!
Speaker B: good.Thanks! You too.
